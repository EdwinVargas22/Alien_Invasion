Created a game, trying to replicate the classic game, Space Invaders. Its not a 100% replication of the classic game, but it does have some similarities. It is still engaging and as you level up, it gets harder. It shows how many lives you have, high score, your score, and level you are on.

## Main points
* Created 8 python files
* One python file is the main one where we run the game in the terminal
* Other 7 python files focus on certain parts that will help to make the Alien Invasion game

Final product:
